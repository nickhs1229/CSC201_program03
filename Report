The objective of this program was to create a series of programs that could verify and compare DNA sequences as a way of understanding how to implement this type of verification and comparison to other forms of code.
The most important variables for completing this code were the replace, zip, and range variables, which were repeatedly implemented throughout the program as a means of analyzing and comparing specific strings relative to either each other or established parameters for characters.
The largest difficulty encountered with this project was developing the specific series of code necessary to compare the lengths of the longest matching sections between two input strings.
While simply counting the number of matches was easy once I discovered and understood the use of the zip command, the latter required repeated testing in order to produce the required output.
Additionally, the output produced by comparing one input to a stored database of strings was somewhat unclear given the fact that each string within the database is not displayed to the user without observing the code itself.
